AlexNet like convolutional neural networkd for sentiment image analysis and prediction on SentiBank
****************************************************************************************************

This code demonstrated building a convolutional neural networkd for sentiment image analysis and prediction

The convolutional architecture is built similar to AlexNet. The database used for sentiment image prediction is SentiBank.

A sample of images are kept here in this github submission. You can download all the images from the link 
http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/vso/download/twitter_dataset.html.

This data set consists of images selected from twitter with different emotions. 

Here, you need to download twitter.rar and unzip into your current directory. 
Also change the current directory in the python code

Python version 3.6.8, Keras 2.2.4
