This code demonstrated building a convolutional neural networkd for sentiment image analysis and prediction

The convolutional architecture is built similar to AlexNet. The database used for sentiment image prediction is SentiBank.

A sample of images are kept here in this github submission. You can download all the images from the link 
http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/vso/download/twitter_dataset.html.

This data set consists of images selected from twitter with different emotions.
